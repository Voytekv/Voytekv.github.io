        GHOST TOWNS
      </p>
      <p>
        Definition: A ghost town is a town or settlement that has been abandoned or is nearly deserted, often due to economic decline, natural or human-made disasters, or the depletion of resources that once supported the population.
      </p>

      <p><h3>But why loose an antire town?</h3></p>
      <p>
        1. Mining booms and busts: Towns built around gold, silver, or coal mines often thrived during the boom, then emptied when the resources ran out. (Ugolny ruchei, Sadon, kadykcahn...) <br>
        2. Changes in transportation routes: When highways or railroads were rerouted, some towns lost vital traffic and business. (Lultin, Charonda...) <br>
        3. Natural disasters: Earthquakes, floods, or droughts have caused entire communities to leave. (Kursha-2, Neftegorsk...) <br>
        4. Economic collapse or war: Factories closing or conflicts can push residents to relocate. (Tiksi-2, Alykel...) <br>
        5. Industrial disasters and incident leading to the non viability of the town (Kyshtym, Verkhnyaya, Namyetkin, Pechenga) </p> 

      <p>
        One of the most famous exemple is in Ukraine, Prypiat, who was within the exclusion zone.
