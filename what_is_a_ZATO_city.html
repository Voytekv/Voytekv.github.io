      <p>(Russian: закрытые административно-территориальные образования [ЗАТО]</p>
      <p>
        Definition: A ZATO city (short for "Закрытое административно-территориальное образование" or Closed Administrative-Territorial Formation [ЗАТО]) is a closed town or city in Russia that has restricted access due to its military, scientific, or strategic significance.

      <p><h3>What's the difference?</h3></p>
      <p>
        <h3>Key features:</h3>
        1. Access is controlled: Entry is typically restricted to residents, employees, or people with special permits.<br>
        2. Often associated with military or nuclear activities: Many ZATO cities have military bases, nuclear facilities, weapons production, or research institutes. <br>
        3. Not always marked on maps: Especially during the Soviet era, many of these cities were kept secret and were not labeled on public maps. (However those still exist today.) <br>
        4. Code names: Instead of using their real names, they were often referred to using a postal code and a nearby city, like “Tomsk-7” or “Arzamas-16.” <br> </p> 

      <p>
        One of the most famous exemple is in Russia, Norislk, who is also the most deppressive city in the world :3 >_<
