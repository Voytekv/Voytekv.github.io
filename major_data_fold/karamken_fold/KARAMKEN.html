      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
        Established in the 1930s as a work settlement along the newly constructed Kolyma Highway, its location was chosen for strategic access to remote gold and silver deposits in the surrounding permafrost.
        In 1964, rich gold–silver ore veins were identified near the original village site. By 1971, construction had begun on a large ore‐enrichment factory above the settlement, which lead to the city's expension and population peak.
        During its peak the processing facility of Karamken, KGOK (Карамкенский горно‐обогатительный комбинат), could treat about 1000 tons of ore each day, and had a workforce of thousands of people.
        By 1995, the local ore deposits were deemed exhausted and the plant was shuttered, precipitating an exodus of miners and their families. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Karamken’s population decreased dramatically as economic support vanished.
        After that, in 2006, the abandon officially began, in 2012 when only 60 residents remained and by 2014, everyone was gone.
        But that's not all, Karamken is infamous for a major environmental catastrophe on 29 August 2009, when the tailings‐dam at the KGOK facility failed. A massive toxic leak obliterated parts of the nearby village, killed two locals, and destroyed a forest plantation along the Khasyn floodplain. The ecosystems suffered severe contamination, destroying aquatic life and polluting drinking‐water sources. Remediation costs goes up to an estimated ₽150 million (≈ $7.5 million).
        Today, the city is silent, debris everywhere and chemicals hazard remains, however it is accessible at your own risks.
