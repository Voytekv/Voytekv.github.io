This is the english translation of the letter wrote by captain S. Kinajenko "КАК НА НЕОБИТАЕМОМ ОСТРОВЕ" puplished by Красная звезда (might contain mistakes):


"We serve on one of the islands of the Kuril ridge. As they usually say, to be honest, our industrial base is still in its infancy. The soldiers live in tents. Sometimes, when the weather is bad and the wind blows, the tent collapses right onto the sleeping people.

There is no club or even a small room where you could get together, read newspapers, watch TV. Letters arrive late, with delays. Mail comes once every three to four weeks. You cannot buy writing paper or envelopes anywhere.

There is practically no way to get to the “mainland.” And still we serve, officers and sailors. And, to be honest, we don’t complain, we endure difficulties, because we understand that such is the army’s fate.

But it is still bitter to realize that these difficulties are not caused by the natural conditions of the island, but by people themselves. It seems as though we are forgotten here. The command’s attitude is precisely such: you can live there, and that’s fine. Soldiers, officers will endure, they are used to hardship.

We did not see any newspaper for two months. Deliveries of books are irregular. Letters, I already mentioned, arrive after long delays. But time goes on, a person is torn away from the living life of the country.

It becomes unbearably heavy when you think: why, in fact, such neglect of people, of their needs? Who needs it? Would the state really lose a lot if the post office worked regularly, if newspapers and magazines arrived here in time?

Impressions are such, as if we live in a different state. Everything passes us by. We are deprived of what every person has the right to count on: communication with the country, with people. It’s offensive and bitter.

We want to believe that our letter will reach the address, that finally we will be heard. After all, the issues raised in it, as it seems to us, are not only our concerns. After all, the fleet is not only warships, aircraft, missile units. It is also dozens of remote garrisons, units and subunits. Their life and combat readiness largely depends on attention to everyday problems.

So, perhaps, it is worth thinking seriously about this?

Captain S. Kupalnishko,
deputy commander of the unit for political affairs."
