      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3>
      <h4>The Japanese era</h4>
      </p>
      <p>
      The Musashi airbase also called Kurabu airbase was firstly built post  by the Japanese army to strenghten defence in the pacific sea. the airbase has two crossed runways, one of 1310,64 meters by 79,248 meters and a second one of 1280,16 meters by 114,3 meters.
      In 1944, there were 4 hangars and by 1944 it had 7 hangars, 57 blast shelters, 23 automatic guns, 11 AA guns, 10 MGs, 2 covered defense guns, and around 300 buildings and 5 radio station, confirmed by photos.
      At one point in 1943, there wer emore than 100 guns located on the island.
      By the end of the second world war the soviets took control of the base, and its runways closed or rarely used, but they seem to have remained on the island until late 90s or early 2000s as pictures of there infrastructures exists.

      <h4>The soviet era, memoirs of participant of Kuril landing A.I. Rodygin (English ver.)</h4>
      Under soviet control, the japanese surrendered and were sent back to japan while some where sent to gulags and work camps, this area is a lot less documented

      The memoir of the soldier, A.I. Rodygin (373rd riffle regiment of the 101st division) talks about how japanese soldiers surrendered and didnt shoot them when they arrived on the island (although some kamikaze soldiers didn't surrender), and even with the high tensions at first even towards civilians ("I'll burn their nest" a soviet soldier mentioned, speaking of potential japanese soldiers hidden in civilians). 
      Over time they still shared a bit there culture and the soviets would eat japanese food.
      In 1946 Most of the soldiers were sent back to the mainland, including Rodygin. (link to the journal at the bottom of the page)
      <h4>After 1946</h4>
      The soviets remained on the island but in much less numbers
      For Musashi airfield, I was able to find a letter a soviet captain (S. Kinajenko / Кинашенко) wrote to the journal "Red Star" (Красная звезда).
      The letter talks about the harsh conditions of living there far away from the mainland and how "left over" the island is, in a way that no one seems to care a lot about the soldiers there.
      And that sometimes the tents the soldier would sleep in could collapse over night, bear in mind it could be as cold as -26°c in winter.
      "Sometimes, when the weather is bad and the wind blows, the tent collapses right onto the sleeping people."
      He also mentions a lot of enssentials things are missing or not rare. While this documents looks very real, it is to take cautiously as I couldn't verify if it is legitimate or made up, none of the archives I could give me the original, and i couldn't find any infos on the captain.

      <h4>After 1991</h4>
      This part is even less documented, i have a lot of pictures which confirms the site was still active to 1997 but nothing really showing how life was there. By that time the airfiled was copletely overgrown, later pictures that seems to be from the area shows decayeing rusted vehicle and ruins.
      Although a par tof the island (North) is still active, and I will not talk about as it isn't abandonned and it is called FSB on google map.
