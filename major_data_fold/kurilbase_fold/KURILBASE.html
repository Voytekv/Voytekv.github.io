      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3>
      <h4>The Japanese era</h4>
      </p>
      <p>
      The Musashi airbase also called Kurabu airbase was firstly built post  by the Japanese army to strenghten defence in the pacific sea. the airbase has two crossed runways, one of 1310,64 meters by 79,248 meters and a second one of 1280,16 meters by 114,3 meters.
      In 1944, there were 4 hangars and by 1944 it had 7 hangars, 57 blast shelters, 23 automatic guns, 11 AA guns, 10 MGs, 2 covered defense guns, and around 300 buildings and 5 radio station, confirmed by photos.
      At one point in 1943, there wer emore than 100 guns located on the island.
      By the end of the second world war the soviets took control of the base, and its runways closed or rarely used, but they seem to have remained on the island until late 90s or early 2000s as pictures of there infrastructures exists.
      <h4>The soviet era, memoirs of participant of Kuril landing A.I. Rodygin (English ver.)</h4>
      Under soviet control, the japanese surrendered and were sent back to japan while some where sent to gulags and work camps, this area is a lot less documented

      While the memory of another soldier, A.I. Rodygin talks about how japanese soldiers surrendered and didnt shoot them when they arrived on the island (although some kamikaze soldiers didn't), and even with the big tensions at first even towards civilians ("I'll burn there nest" a soviet soldier mentioned speaking of potential japanese soldiers hidden in civilians). 
      Over time they still shared a bit there culture and the soviet would eat japanese food.
      In 1946 Most of the soldiers were sent back to the mainland, including Rodygin.
      The soviets remained on the island and is today still a part of Russia (Sakhalin oblast), with still some active parts of the island, and I will not document tht one for obvious reasons as it is an FSB facility (this information isn't secret it's litteraly named like that on google map).
      For Musashi airfield, I was able to find a letter a soviet captain (S. Kinajenko / Кинашенко) wrote to the journal "Red Star" (Красная звезда).
      The letter talks about the harsh conditions of living there far away from the mainland and how "left over" the island is, in a way that no one seems to care a lot about the soldiers there.
