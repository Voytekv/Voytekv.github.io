      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
      Exceptionally severe Arctic conditions, long harsh winters, short summers, and continuous permafrost.
      The nearby Tus-Takh salt dome (a Paleozoic formation) drew early exploration hopes for hydrocarbons beneath salt structures. Fossil remains of the plesiosaur Plesiosaurus robustus were also uncovered on the peninsula
      In 1933, the Soviet administration Glavsevmorput (Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route) dispatched the ice-capable freighter Pravda with an oil-prospecting team led by geologist N. N. Urvantsev.
      On 4 September 1933, Pravda attempted to enter Nordvik Bay from the east without proper soundings and twice ran aground between Poluostrov Paksa and Bolshoy Begichev Island.
      The place was also used for oil rigs but wasn't much successful with that, only small amount of oils were made.
      Although oil prospects failed, the logistical and technical expertise gained in extreme permafrost exploration later proved to be benficial for Western Siberia’s vast oil and gas reserves  exploitation.
      The settlement was kinda a gulag penal colony was set up to exploit the Tus-Takh salt dome. Forced-labour prisoners extracted and shipped salt to supply the Soviet northern fisheries.
      Without a viable economic base, the settlement dwindled and was officially closed in 1956, leaving infrastructure, buildings, and dockwork to the encroaching tundra
