      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
        Berezniki-2 was part of the Soviet Union's extensive network of ZATOs (Закрытое административно-территориальное образование), or Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations. These towns were off-limits to outsiders and often didn’t appear on maps. Berezniki-2 was primarily involved in chemical production, particularly the handling and synthesis of compounds used for fertilizers and military-grade materials.
        Much of the town's existence revolved around uranium enrichment, chemical weapon components, and heavy industrial processes linked to the Soviet military-industrial complex. Due to the sensitive nature of the work, movement in and out of the town was heavily restricted, and workers were often bound by secrecy.
        By the 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, Berezniki-2 was gradually dismantled. Many facilities were decommissioned, and the population was either relocated or absorbed into the larger city of Berezniki. Some structures remain, but much of the area is now off-limits or heavily degraded.
        Imagery pending. Archival materials under review.

        There is no credible evidence that “chemical rains”, as in intentional or accidental precipitation of nerve agents or other battlefield-grade toxins have ever fell over Berezniki-2 in the 1980s. Contemporary archival records, environmental surveys of the secret city, and later declassified reports make no mention of such events.
        What did occur, however, was industrial acid rain in the broader Berezniki area, driven by sulfur and nitrogen-oxide emissions from potash and chemical plants (though not chemical-weapons facilities). Studies of the region’s snow cover have shown elevated levels of trace metals and acidification typical of heavy industrial pollution. However nothing to suggest nerve-agent or chemical-weapons contamination in precipitation

      <p>The exact, officially published coordinates for the secret “closed city” Berezniki-2 (a.k.a. B-20) remain classified and are not available in open sources. However, declassified mapping exercises and satellite‐imagery analyses place it just east of the main urban area of Berezniki, around 59.42 ° N, 56.83 ° E (near the eastern bank of the Kama River, about 3–5 km from central Berezniki)</p>
