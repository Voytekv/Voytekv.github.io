      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
        In 1961, the Norilsk city council discreetly allocated land for “Object №1305,” later revealed to be a military airfield. Construction was carried out by the Soviet Army’s 37th Separate Airfield Construction Regiment (unit 21004), whose job was to build and maintain runway infrastructure and support other military outposts across the Taymyr Peninsula.
        At its height, particularly between 1987 and 1990, some military transport aircraft and helicopters operated from the Alykel's airfield, representing about 3–4 percent of the regiment’s personnel. The town served as a logistical point for supplying remote Arctic military sites.
        With the end of the Cold War and the subsequent drawdown of Soviet military forces, unit 21004 was disbanded. Once the regiment left, Alykel’s purpose to exist disappeared, and the settlement was vacated almost overnight. The airport itself transitioned to civilian use as Alykel International Airport, while the town’s concrete buildings started to decay.
        However the ruins are being dismantled so every years less and less buildings are left standing.
        On 16 November 1981, Aeroflot Flight 3603, a Tupolev Tu-154, crashed while attempting to land at Norilsk Airport. Ninety-nine of the 167 passengers and crew on board were killed in the accident.
