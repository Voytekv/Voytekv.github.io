      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <div>
        <p>Right after World War II, the Soviet leadership, under the direction of Lavrentiy Beria, initiated a massive program to produce nuclear weapons. A remote site in the southern Ural Mountains—chosen for its existing industrial infrastructure and the newly built power station supplying nearby “Tankograd” was selected. The construction began in 1945, primarily using forced labor: over 40,000 Gulag prisoners and German POWs built the reactors, and the accompanying closed town, officially designated by its postal code as Chelyabinsk-40. The first reactor, A-1, commenced operation in late 1948, feeding plutonium into the atomic test device RDS-1 detonated in August 1949, marking the Soviet Union’s entry into the nuclear era. </p><br> 
        <p>Built under the strictest secrecy, Chelyabinsk-40 was one of the Soviet Union’s most sensitive “closed cities,” invisible on official maps. Access was limited to those with special passes, and the town existed only as a string of digits to the outside world. Over the next decade, Mayak, the name of the complex was expanded to ten reactors with a combined thermal capacity exceeding 7,000 MWth, four of which were dedicated to plutonium production. By the end of the Cold War, Mayak had yielded 31 tons of weapons-grade plutonium, about a fifth of the USSR’s total production. however, the wastes were dumped into the nearby lake "Karachay V9", which caused it to become the most poluted lake in the world and the most lethal too, slowly the vegettation and forest around the facility died, which alerted the facility operators and lead to the construction of a waste tank in alluminium and concrete 8 meters deep in the ground, however the cooling system's control pannel was too close to the contrete, so anyone operating it would get server radiation poisoning, leading to death. </p><br>
        <p>On 29 September 1957, an oxide-coated steel storage tank holding high-level radioactive waste exploded without warning, in what would later be termed the Kyshtym disaster. The blast released \~20 MCi of radionuclides into the surrounding environment, contaminating an area of roughly 20,000 km². Initial radiation surveys were conducted only after local dosimeters detected alarming spikes. Contaminated dust was tracked into Chelyabinsk-40 on workers’ shoes and vehicles, prompting emergency measures such as shoe-washing stations and vehicle decontamination at the town’s entrance. The true scale of the accident remained concealed until the late Soviet period. Today the number of death admitted by the russian authorities is 200-300 depending the source, however that number in reality much bigger, an estimated 4000 to 10 000+ casualities. </p><br>
        <p>Starting in 1951, the nearby Lake Karachay served as an open-air dump for Mayak’s liquid waste. Over time, sediment in the lake bed accumulated an estimated 4.4 PBq (in comparison, Chernobyl released around 5 to 20 PBq but on the entire continent, unlike here, where it is thousands of times more concentrated, however later in Europe labs would detect a radioactive isotope that when analysed and put together with weather broadcasts and winds, shows it might be from Mayak) of radioactivity. In 1968, a drought shrank the lake, and radioactive dust swept across half a million residents in what has been described as “the largest uncontrolled release of radioactivity in history” (please note that this was prior to chernobyl). </p><br>
        <p>Workers at Mayak and residents of Chelyabinsk-40 (and downstream villages along the Techa River) suffered significant radiation exposure. Medical personnel, forbidden to record “radiation sickness” in official diagnoses, coined the term “special disease” to describe chronic conditions such as anemia, cataracts, and increased cancer rates. Only after Khrushchev’s de-Stalinization policies in the late 1950s did some victims receive belated recognition and compensation and eventually were relocated for most. Investigations in the 1990s revealed that up to 65% of residents in nearby settlements exhibited markers of chronic radiation illness (reports shows skin falling off the head and hands). </p><br>
        <p>With the dissolution of the USSR, Chelyabinsk-40 was officially renamed Chelyabinsk-65 in 1960 and finally granted municipal status as Ozyorsk in 1994. Information about the town’s true purpose and the Mayak facility gradually emerged, spurring international scientific collaboration on radiological monitoring and health studies. Today, Ozyorsk remains a closed municipality under Russia’s Rosatom, its legacy a stark reminder of the environmental and human costs of the nuclear arms race.</p>
