      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
        Originally a seasonal Yupik encampment attested since the 19th century, Nunyamo was transformed in 1958–1959 when Soviet authorities, pursuing a project of concentrating indigenous populations into “promising” settlements with modern infrastructure, forcibly relocated most residents of <a><href="major_data_fold/naukan_fold/NAUKAN.html>Naukan</a> west to newly built facilities at Cape Nunyamo and nearby Uelen
        Despite these investments, the settlement was officially deemed unviable and, in 1977, abandoned on orders of the regional administration. Its remaining inhabitants were moved to the larger villages of Lavrentiya and Lorino
        Although left deserted for many years, Nunyamo’s buildings and pier have occasionally been used since the 1990 s by local hunters and fishermen as a temporary base during spring and autumn expeditions. Today, all that remains are crumbling foundations and the skeletal frame of a once-modern Arctic village, enduring until mid-20th century ghost of the resilience of Chukchi-Yupik lifeways.
