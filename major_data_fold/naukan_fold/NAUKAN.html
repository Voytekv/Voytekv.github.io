      <p><h3>Basic info</h3></p>
      <p>The easternmost village of the Eurasian continent. Was mainly inhabited by Yupik people, a group of indigenous people who speak Naukan (also a language). The habitation prior to CCCP were mainly wooden houses and structures using whale bones, since the Yupik would hunt whales. During the Cold War, it was evacuated to avoid possible military confrontations with the USA and to pull the people towards bigger cities, since Naukan was too remote to be "economically efficient".
      The Yupiks were primarily resettled in Nunyamo (who is also a ghost town now). There are three monuments in Naukan: a bust made in 1648 to commemorate Semyon Ivanovich Dezhnev (Russian explorer), reaching the village, a wooden cross built at the lighthouse in 1910, and another monument by B. K. Semenenko in 1956. Before the eviction, approximately 400 people lived in Naukan. Today the remains are still visible.</p>
