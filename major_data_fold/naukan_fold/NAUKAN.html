      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>The easternmost village of the Eurasian continent. Was mainly habited by Yupik poeple, a group of indigenous people who speak Naukan (also a language). The habitation prior to CCCP were mainly wodden houses and strucates using whale bones, since the Yupik would hunt whales. During the cold war it was evacuated to avoid possible military confrontations with the USA and to pull the people towards bigger cities, since Naukan was too remote to be "economicaly efficient".
      The Yupiks were primarly restled in Nunyamo (who is also a ghost town now). There are three momuments in Naukan, a bust made in 1648 to commemorate Semyon Ivanovich Dezhnev(Russian explorer), reaching the village, a wooden cross built at the lighthouse in 1910 and another monument by B. K. Semenenko in 1956. Before the eviction Aproximately 400 people lived in Naukan. Today the remains are still visible</p>
