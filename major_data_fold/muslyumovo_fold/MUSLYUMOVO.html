      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <div>
        Old Muslyumovo was originally a Tatar village located on the Techa River, in the southern Ural region of Russia. For most of its history, it was a quiet rural settlement with a population composed mainly of Muslim Tatars and Bashkirs.
        Then, in the 1940s the soviets started their nuclear program, starting the process of uranium enrichment. The Mayak complex was made (about 75km away from Muslyumovo).
        After 1949, the Mayak facility started dumping their toxic and radiactive waste in the nearby lakes, including Karachay V9 (the deadliest lake today) and the Techa river, which was flowing throughout Muslyumovo.
        So the radioactive contamination began, the residents of the downstream villages werent informed of the contamination.
        In 1957, the mayak facility had its infamous incident, when a storage tank of nuclear waste exploded, now known as the Kyshtym disaster (named after a nearby town since Ozersk was a secret city and did not officially exist) leading to massive amounts of extremely radioactive wastes being released a bit everywhere.
        The kyshtym disaster is the third worst nuclear incident today, but back in 1957, it was the worst all time.
        However the residents weren't informed or evacuated, which led to extreme high cancer rates, genetic mutations, birth defects, radiation sickness (chronic variant), and more. But there were also psychological trauma, with suicide rates increasing in the new generation, due to them not wanting to live with such mutations.
        Muslyumovo wasn't evacuated until 2005-2010, but not everyone was evacuated, its only after 2015 that it became largely abandoned, however some families remains.
