      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <p>
        The island of Shalim was first settled as Heretiki before the Novgorod Republic, later renamed Heretics. In 1883, industrialist Hermann Goebel founded a whaling company there. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich visited in 1885, prompting the building of a church and the renaming of the settlement to Port Vladimir in his honor.
        By 1905, the village was small but began to grow under Soviet rule, becoming a working village in 1935. During the 1930s, it hosted a Gulag labor camp. Infrastructure like a school, hospital, and fish processing facilities were added by the 1940s. After WWII, Kola Norwegians were relocated there.
        By the 1950s, the village had various facilities and a population of 1,718 by 1959. In 1969, civilians were forcibly relocated to the mainland, leaving only the military. After the Soviet Union's collapse, the military left in 1994, and the island has had no permanent population since.
        Since 2001, former residents have made annual visits. In 2007, Port Vladimir and other settlements were officially abolished.
