      <p><h3>Basic infos</h3></p>
      <div>
        Mys Shmidta was first reached by James Cook in 1778.
        When James sailed through the Bering Strait and into the Chukchi Sea, he proved to people in Europe and North America that Russia and Alaska were separated.
        It was founded in 1931 as a part of the Soviet Union's development of its Arctic air defenses. However the recent decades have led to a decline in the settlement's importance, although it remains Chukotka's most important northern sea port after Pevek.
        And later in 1954, an airstrip was added to be used by strategic bombers.
        However due to the hostile weather the bombers were most of the time, in bases further in the south.
        In 1962, Mys Shmidta was granted urban-type settlement status, and the population reached it's peak in 1989 at 4587 habitants.
        The harsh climate is very cold in winter (from -30 to -41 on average per months) but normal from Jun to Aug (around 20°c).
        However the humidity is at all time high with around 85% of humidity, and sometimes no sunshine hours for a month.
