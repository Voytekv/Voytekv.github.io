# README
The final version of the russian listing project.

Documents russian ghost towns, mapping anomalies, ZATO cities. I am not sure of how far i'll go with this project. I wanted to make a website but had no idea how so i figured i'll just use some tricks on github.

I am quite scared seeing how many clones in lne day this site got as it only been up for a few days.

I had this thing in my mind for a few weeks and i wanted to make a website that would categorize, documents, and list as many abandonned, closed towns or mapping anomalies.

This list will document Russian/Soviet ghost towns, ZATO cities and mapping anomalies.

I have no idea how to pick a license dont be mad if i do something wrong plz.

I have barelly any idea of how gitHub warks so i'll probably do many mistakes.
I can't even make a proper website, but seriously github is so confusing.

Keep going: [urbanghost.ru project](https://voytekv.github.io)
