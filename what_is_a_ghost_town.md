What is a ghost town uh? 
> I only put this here to make it clean, but seriously if you don't know what a ghost town is we can't be friend.

# A ghost town is a town or settlement that has been abandoned or is nearly deserted, often due to economic decline, natural or human-made disasters, or the depletion of resources that once supported the population. <ch1>

* Common reasons towns become "ghost towns":
1. Mining booms and busts: Towns built around gold, silver, or coal mines often thrived during the boom, then emptied when the resources ran out.
2. Changes in transportation routes: When highways or railroads were rerouted, some towns lost vital traffic and business.
3. Natural disasters: Earthquakes, floods, or droughts have caused entire communities to leave.
4. Economic collapse or war: Factories closing or conflicts can push residents to relocate.
